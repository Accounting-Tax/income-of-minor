# Income of Minors 2024

## Overview
Minors are defined as individuals under 18 years of age at the end of the income year. Special taxation rules apply to minors, primarily designed to discourage income splitting, where adults divert income to their children to reduce tax liabilities.

## Prescribed Minors
- A prescribed minor is defined under Division 6AA of ITAA36 as a person under 18 at the end of the income year who is not an excepted person.
  
## Excepted Minors
- Defined under s.102AC(2) of ITAA36, excepted minors include:
  - Minors engaged in full-time occupations on the last day of the year or employed full-time for at least three months during the income year.
  - Minors receiving disability support, rehabilitation allowances, or carer allowances.
  - Minors entitled to double orphan pensions.
  - Those unable to work due to permanent disabilities or blindness.
  - Minors intending to work full-time or not planning to study full-time for most of the income year.

## Tax Implications
- **Excepted Minors**: Taxed at ordinary marginal tax rates.
- **Prescribed Minors**: Taxed at Division 6AA penalty rates unless the income is classified as excepted assessable income, in which case it is taxed at marginal rates.

## Assessable Income
- **Eligible Assessable Income**: Includes unearned income like dividends, interest, rent, royalties, and family trust distributions. Division 6AA tax rates apply.
- **Excepted Assessable Income**: Includes wages, business income (if the minor has control over the income), pensions from Centrelink or Veteran's Affairs, income from compensatory damages awards, superannuation payments, and certain trust income (like from a deceased estate).

## Taxation of Eligible and Excepted Assessable Income
- **Only Excepted Assessable Income**: Taxed at ordinary marginal tax rates.
- **Both Excepted and Eligible Assessable Income**: Excepted income is taxed at ordinary marginal rates, while eligible income is taxed at Division 6AA rates.
- **Only Eligible Assessable Income**: Taxed at Division 6AA rates.

## Division 6AA Tax Rates
- Taxable income ranges and rates:
  - $0 to $416: Nil
  - $417 to $1,307: 66% on excess over $416
  - $1,308 and above: 45% flat rate on the whole taxable income.

## Low Income Tax Offset (LITO) and Minors
- Since July 1, 2011, the LITO has been unavailable for the unearned income of minors, reducing the tax-free amount for distributed income to $416.
- Income earned by minors from employment is still eligible for the full LITO benefit.
